# Happy Industry - Material Registration and Cost Reporting System
## Overview
Happy Industry is a web application developed from April to June 2024 as part of a challenging project during my Software Engineering course at PUCPR. The application is designed to assist industries in managing materials, recording prices, and generating detailed cost reports. This was my first extensive project in web development, built using Python (Flask) for the back-end, HTML, CSS, and MySQL for data storage.

## Features
Material Registration: Users can register materials, specifying details like material type, cost, and supplier information.
Price Management: The system allows updating and managing material prices.
Cost Reporting: Automatically generates comprehensive reports based on material usage and costs, helping industries track and optimize their expenses.
User-friendly Interface: Designed with a focus on ease of use, featuring a clean and simple UI.

## Technologies Used
Back-end: Python with Flask framework.
Front-end: HTML5, CSS3 for styling and layout.
Database: MySQL for storing and managing material and price data.
Reports: Automatically generated cost reports in an easy-to-understand format.
